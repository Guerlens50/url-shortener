## üìù Project Overview

This project is a **scalable URL shortener service** that allows users to shorten URLs, track clicks, monitor analytics, and discover trending links.  
It is optimized for **performance and security**, using Redis caching, MySQL analytics, and Celery workers for asynchronous tasks.

The system also integrates **fraud detection** to prevent abuse, tracks **unique visitors**, and calculates **trending scores** using weighted recent clicks.

## üèó Architecture

```text
Client: Sends requests to Flask API

Flask API: Handles auth, URL shortening, redirects, and analytics

Redis: Caches short URLs, trending URLs, and enforces rate limits

MySQL: Stores users, URLs, clicks, hourly analytics, and sequences

Celery Workers: Handle asynchronous click logging and fraud detection

Prometheus: Collects and exposes metrics for observability
